		<h3>Welcome to my Website</h3>
		<p>Currently, I am a sophomore at Colby College in Waterville, ME.
		I am pursuing a major in Economics with a concentration in Financial Markets
		and a minor in Computer Science. At Colby, I am a member of the Colby Men's Basketball Team,
		the Mayflower Hill Student Investment Club, the Colby Golf Team and work the front desk of Wadsworth Gymnasium.
		Last summer, I was an accounting intern for Windsor Distributing Inc. in Naples, Florida. In addition,
		I attended the London School of Economics and took a summer school Accounting course.
		This summer, I will be interning at ChalkTalk, Inc. in Palo Alto, California. Along with my internship,
		I will be participating in a Finance Accelerator Program run by ModernGuild and Citi. 
		I am interested in both business and technology and hope to pursue an career in either.
		Aside from school, I like to lift weights, take photos, and play the guitar.
		In my free time, I'm learning how to mix music as a DJ and how to code with HTML.
