    <h1>Anthony J. Karalekas</h1>
    <h3>Welcome to my Website</h3>
    <p>Currently, I am a sophomore at Colby College in Waterville, ME.
    I am pursuing a major in Economics with a concentration in Financial Markets
    and a minor in Computer Science. At Colby, I am a member of the Colby Men's Basketball Team,
    the Mayflower Hill Student Investment Club, and work the front desk of Wadsworth Gymnasium.
    Last summer, I was an accounting intern for Windsor Distributing Inc. in Naples, Florida. In addition,
    I attended the London School of Economics and took a summer school Accounting course.
    This summer, I will be interning at ChalkTalk, Inc. in Palo Alto, California. Along with my internship,
    I will be participating in a Finance Accelerator Program run by ModernGuild and Citi. 
    I am interested in both business and technology and hope to pursue an career in either.
    In my free time, I like to lift weights, take photos, play guitar and mix music as a DJ.
